Welcome to AdLib.js!
===
This file is used to make some usually bulky aspects of code simple. Currently its only functionality is to store arrays in localStorage.
 - [Latest.js](https://github.com/AdamRaichu/code/blob/main/adlib/latest.js) will always be updated to include the most recent functional code (so BETA versions are not immediately pushed).
 - [Version.js](https://github.com/AdamRaichu/code/blob/main/adlib/version.js) should be included in every page this library is used. This is so the console can alert you when you are not using the latest available version. (Note: this does not work on 1-0-0 as that functionality was added in 1-2.)
